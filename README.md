# network-ping-dashboard
This application is a web dashboard designed to monitor the status of network devices based on their IP addresses. Using HTTP requests (HEAD method) in JavaScript, the system tests each device within a time limit and classifies it as either ONLINE or OFFLINE.  The results are displayed in an organized table that shows, for each device, its name, IP address, and status, along with overall counters indicating how many devices are online and how many are offline. To improve readability, OFFLINE devices are always listed first and highlighted in red, followed by ONLINE devices highlighted in green, allowing users to quickly identify potential issues in the network through a simple, intuitive dashboard built for internal corporate use.
